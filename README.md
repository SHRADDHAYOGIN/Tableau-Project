# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
1. Connect your data
2. Detect different data types in your data
3. Build at least 5 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset. 
4. How Population and Birth rate affects Number Of Deaths.
5. How Different countries has number of Deaths through out years.
6. Find Pattern and Outliner.
## Process
1.Finding Top N causes having highest Number of death numbers using packed bubbles graph.
2.Finding countries having highest number of deaths using geometric graph.
3.Finding percentage causes in death numbers country and year wise using bar chart.
4.Rate of Deaths through out years in world and countries using line graph with average line.
5.Finding outliner from group of countries for different causes using box plot.
6.Finding relation between population and death ratio using scatter plot and trend line.
7.Creating cluster by Death rate and Birth rate using scatter plot.
8.Deaths Occurred by particular causes in world and countries.
9.Representation of death number according to income wise group given by world bank and commonwealth using tree maps and pie chart.

step 1: Clean and Join data in Tableau.
2.Find and download population and birth rate data connect it.
3.Define Questions.
4.Prepare all visualization mentioned above.
5.crate dashboard and stories accordingly.
6.Analyse the visualization and get result.


## Results
1.I choose option 2 Causes of Death-Our world in data.
2.Through my visualization I tried to answer following questions.
Questions
1)What is rate of Death in Different part of World?
2)What are the major causes of deaths in different country and World?
3)How major event affects Death rate?
4)What is relation between number of deaths and population?
5)Any comparison in Birth rate and Death rate?
6)How income wise created groups of world have death numbers?
3.My  data question was how certain events because of causes in countries affects the Death numbers past or particular years?
I found certain interesting facts like
1)India, China and USA has highest death rate and it is gradually increasing and part reson of that is population.
2)Cardiovascular diseases has highest death number but it is gradually decreasing.
3)Some causes have more impact on certain countries and it is because of geometrical structure like poisoning in India, diarrhea due to high temperature, HIV/AIDS because of poor awareness, Terrorism and interpersonal violence.
4)certain events in history also increase number of deaths because of that particular cause like civil wars, Terrorist attack and outburst of diseases like malaria.



## Challenges 
1)Defining Questions. There is lot of Data and we can learn a lot of information with it but in certain time choose priority on information is challenge.
2)Selecting model for questions.
3)preparing Dashboard and creating actions with different params.


## Future Goals
1)Presenting more clearly.
2)Define goal more accurate.
